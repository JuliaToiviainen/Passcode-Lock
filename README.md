# Passcode-Lock
Passcode Lock Project

As a part of CMPT Embodded computer systems I learned to attain a system-level understanding of the computer. In this class I build an embodded computer project using arduino and hardware. My project was a password-lock system where a user could open the lock by using a 4x4 Matrix keyboard. If the user entered the correct passcode the lock would open and the lock was programmed to lock it self for longer period of time after 3 incorrect guesses. The project consisted of 4 major hardware parts, Keypad, Servo motor, LED lights and the LCD screen. This assignment made me really understand how to combine hardware with software and offered me a lot of creativity as we were encouranged to build whatever we wanted. Of course this made me critically to think what could be possible and what would be too much of reach. All in all I liked the project as I could really see the work of what I did and it offered a fun challenge of how to combine different parst of computer science.
